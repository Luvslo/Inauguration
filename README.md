# The Inaguration

## A text based PHP Game

### Frontend

To set up frontend, you must get a PHP server up. Whether it is through apache or a web server.

### Backend

There are two folders with almost identical contents.

WithDB - The database must be connected and configured in `dbc.php`. The attached sql file contains an export of the database used.
WithoutDB - There is no need to configure backend. All data is organized within the frontend.
